# Movie Recommendation System

### **Overview**
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on user preferences and behavior. It leverages the **MovieLens dataset** to analyze ratings, genres, tags, and user activity to provide personalized recommendations.

---

### **Datasets Used**
The project uses the following files from the MovieLens dataset:
1. `movies.csv`: Movie titles and genres.
2. `ratings.csv`: User ratings for movies.
3. `tags.csv`: User-applied tags for movies.
4. `links.csv`: Mapping MovieLens IDs to IMDb and TMDb IDs.
5. `genome-tags.csv`: Descriptive tags for movies.
6. `genome-scores.csv`: Relevance scores for tags.

**Dataset Source**: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)  
(MovieLens is a project by GroupLens at the University of Minnesota.)

### **Key Steps**
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Imported all required datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Addressed missing values (e.g., replaced null tags with `"No Tag"`).
   - Ensured consistency across datasets.
3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Analyzed user behavior, rating distributions, and popular genres.
4. **Building Recommendation System**:
   - Preparing for algorithms like Collaborative and Content-Based Filtering.

### **Features**
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Understand patterns in user activity and ratings.
- **Genre Analysis**: Explore popular genres and trends.
- **Tag-Based Insights**: Use descriptive tags for nuanced recommendations.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: For building recommendation models.

---

### **Next Steps**
- Implement recommendation algorithms.
- Add evaluation metrics to measure recommendation accuracy.
- Incorporate external data (e.g., IMDb or TMDb ratings).
